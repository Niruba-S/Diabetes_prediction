# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for effective management and prevention of complications. This project utilizes a dataset containing various health parameters to train an SVM model, which can then predict the probability of diabetes occurrence.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from kaggle. and contains a variety of features related to diabetes risk factors, including glucose levels, BMI, age, blood pressure, and other relevant parameters. The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers, ensuring the quality of input data for training the SVM model.
